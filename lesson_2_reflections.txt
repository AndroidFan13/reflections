What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder, which contains all the metadata about this repository, is created. We have to do it because otherwise we won't be able to use git commands on this directory.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a "limbo" between working dir and repository. There dirty souls of your files are cleaned by commits.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
